🏫 Flow with Web Portal + Self-Registration
1. School Registration (Web Portal)

School admin signs up on the portal.

Creates school profile (name, address, logo, contact info).

Gets unique school code/domain (e.g., myschool.yourapp.com).

2. School Admin (after registration)

Add classes + sections.

Bulk upload students (CSV/Excel).

Add teachers (emails/phone → teachers get login invite).

Assign class teachers + subject teachers.

3. Timetable Management

School admin or class teacher designs timetable.

System suggests auto-timetable (based on teacher free slots).

Periods linked to subject teachers.

4. Class Teacher

Doesn’t “approve” (as you said), but acts as coordinator.

Forwards parent queries to subject teacher or admin.

Forwards homework/notifications from subject teacher to parents.

Can also post homework, complaints, or notifications directly.

Tracks student performance dashboards.

5. Subject Teacher

Linked to classes via timetable.

Can post homework, complaints, announcements → automatically stored + sent to class teacher & parents.

Update student marks & attendance for their subjects.

6. Parents

Register via invite / student code from school.

View: timetable, homework, attendance, notifications, grades.

Ask questions → routed to class teacher.

Get school circulars, announcements.

7. Dashboards

Admin Dashboard → full school (classes, teachers, attendance stats).

Class Teacher Dashboard → their class (attendance %, homework, issues).

Parent Dashboard → per student progress (attendance, grades, homework completion).

🔑 Key Changes From Your Update

School can self-register on web → no manual onboarding.

Class teacher is a coordinator → they don’t “approve,” just forward or communicate.

Centralized process → every action (homework, complaint, Q&A) flows through class teacher → parents.

Web + Mobile synergy →

Web → used by admins & teachers.

Mobile App → used by parents & teachers (quick updates, push notifications).
