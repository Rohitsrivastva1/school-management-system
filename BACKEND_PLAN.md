# 🏗️ School Management System - Backend Development Plan

## 📋 System Overview
Multi-tenant school management system with web portal for admins/teachers and mobile app for parents/teachers.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Firebase Storage
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Email**: SendGrid/Mailgun
- **API**: RESTful API with GraphQL consideration

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Multi-tenant schools
schools (
  id, name, address, logo_url, contact_info, 
  domain, created_at, updated_at
)

-- User roles: admin, teacher, parent, student
users (
  id, email, password_hash, role, school_id,
  first_name, last_name, phone, profile_image,
  is_active, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Classes and sections
classes (
  id, school_id, name, section, academic_year,
  class_teacher_id, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Students linked to classes
students (
  id, user_id, class_id, roll_number, admission_date,
  parent_id, date_of_birth, address, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Teachers and their subjects

  id, user_id, employee_id, subjects, 
  qualification, joining_date, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Timetable management

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation
- Access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens (7 days)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant isolation via school_id

### User Roles & Permissions
```javascript
const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: 'admin',           // School admin
  CLASS_TEACHER: 'class_teacher',
  SUBJECT_TEACHER: 'subject_teacher',
  PARENT: 'parent',
  STUDENT: 'student'
}

const PERMISSIONS = {
  MANAGE_SCHOOL: ['admin'],
  MANAGE_CLASSES: ['admin', 'class_teacher'],
  MANAGE_STUDENTS: ['admin', 'class_teacher'],
  MANAGE_TEACHERS: ['admin'],
  MARK_ATTENDANCE: ['class_teacher', 'subject_teacher'],
  POST_HOMEWORK: ['class_teacher', 'subject_teacher'],
  VIEW_DASHBOARD: ['admin', 'class_teacher', 'parent']
