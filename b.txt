🏗 Proposed Architecture
Web (Admin Panel)

Frontend: Next.js

Used by school admins and teachers.

Admin → manages school, classes, teachers, students.

Teacher → manages timetable, homework, attendance, complaints.

Backend API: Express.js (REST or GraphQL)

Auth (JWT or session-based).

Multi-tenant (each school is a tenant → separated by school_id).

Handles timetable, attendance, homework, complaints, Q&A.

Connects to Postgres.

Mobile App (Parents & Teachers)

Built with Android Studio (since you’re targeting native Android first).

Roles:

Parent Login → child progress, homework, attendance, Q&A with class teacher.

Teacher Login → attendance, homework upload, complaints, forwarding Q&A.

Communicates with the same Express backend API.

Uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications (for homework/alerts).

Database (Postgres)

Multi-tenant design:

users (role: admin, teacher, parent, student).

schools → linked to users via school_id.

classes, sections, students, teachers.

attendance, timetable, homework, complaints, notifications, qa.

🔑 Suggestions / Improvements

Multi-Tenant Handling

Keep all schools in one database (shared schema with school_id filters).

Easier to manage, scale, and update.

Authentication

JWT (access + refresh tokens).

Role-based access (admin, class teacher, subject teacher, parent).

File & Media Storage

Use AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for homework files, student photos.

Store only file links in Postgres.

Notifications

Push notifications via FCM (mobile).

Email notifications (via SendGrid/Mailgun) for web users (admins/teachers).

Timetable Suggestion (Phase 2 feature)

Start with manual timetable creation.

Later: add an auto-scheduler algorithm (based on teacher availability + subject load).

Dashboards

Build role-based dashboards in Next.js:

Admin → whole school analytics.

Teacher → class-level stats.

Parent → per-student progress.

Future-Proofing

Later, you can build an iOS app easily if you shift from pure Android Studio → Flutter.

But for MVP, your Android-first approach is fine (since most parents/teachers use Android in India).

🚀 Recommended MVP Development Order

School Registration (Web, Next.js + Express)

School signup → create classes, add teachers, bulk upload students.

Teacher Portal (Web + Android)

Attendance marking.

Homework upload.

Complaints/notifications.

Parent App (Android)

View attendance, timetable, homework, notifications.

Q&A system with class teacher.

Dashboards (Web)

School admin: all classes, students, teachers overview.

Class teacher: per-class stats.

Parent: child’s progress.
